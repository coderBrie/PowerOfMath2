## AWS Project - Architect and Build an End-to-End AWS Web Application
In this hands-on project, I‚Äôll walk you through how to design and build a simple web application from scratch.  We‚Äôll pick five different services‚ÄîAmplify, Lambda, IAM, API Gateway and DynamoDB‚Äîand talk about why/where to use them, and how to get them to work with each other.  As we go, we‚Äôll build out each of the services, resulting in a fully-functional math web application.

## The Application Architecture

What do we need?

- A way to create/host a webpage
- A way to involke the math functionality
- A way to do some math
- Somewhere to store/return the math result
- A way to handle permissions

## Step 1: Create an index.html page from scratch in a text editor
Open your text editor, create an index.html file and paste the code below:

 ```bash
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
            <head>
                <meta charset="UTF-8">
                <title>To the Power of Math!</title>
            </head>

            <body>
                To the Power of Math!
            </body>
        </html>

   ```

## Step 2: Deploying and hosting a web page with AWS Amplify
what we need to do is zip just the index.html file, now we're going to use amplify to deploy it.

In the aws console navigate to  amplify, click Get Started on Amplify Hosting:

Select Deploy without Git Provider:

![Screenshot](/images/img_3.png)

Give the app a name, i'm going to call mine "power of math", the environment name i'm going to use "dev" and we want to drag and drop that zip file that we created:

![Screenshot](/images/img_4.png)

Save and deploy, after the deployement is successfully completed, you can access the link under Domain, open it on a new tab, we now have a live web page that users can navigate to:

![Screenshot](/images/img_5.png)

## Step 3: Creating a Python Lambda function to implement our math functionality
we're going to use a lambda function as you might know a lambdafunction is just a bit of code that runs in response to some trigger for example when you upload a picture to an s3 bucket that could trigger a lambda function to go process the picture into a thumbnail or something like that it's just code or functions really sitting out there that get run when you need them and these are serverless meaning that you don't have to set up and manage servers to run the code it just happens automatically behind the scenes for you
so we'll write some python code and use the python math library to do the calculations that we need.

Back here on the console go ahead and open up new tab this time we're going to navigate to lambda, create a funtion:

![Screenshot](/images/img_6.png)

Then for function name i'm going to do "power of math function", in my case for runtime let's go with the latest version of python 3.11 , you can leave everything else the same and create function down here on the lower right:

![Screenshot](/images/img_7.png)


Fom the Code Source section, copy and replace the lambda function code provided below: 

 ```bash
      # import the JSON utility package
        import json
        # import the Python math library
        import math

        # define the handler function that the Lambda service will use an entry point
        def lambda_handler(event, context):

        # extract the two numbers from the Lambda service's event object
        mathResult = math.pow(int(event['base']), int(event['exponent']))

        # return a properly formatted JSON object
        return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': json.dumps('Your result is ' + str(mathResult))
        }

   ```


   Replace and paste the lambda function code, save the changes and make sure to deploy by cliking the deploy button:

   ![Screenshot](/images/img_8.png)


## Step 4: Testing our Lambda function
let's test to make sure this functions work as we expect, click the little drop down arrow to the
right of test: 

![Screenshot](/images/img_9.png)

Set up a test event this basically lets us pass in some test data to make sure that the function's working, create a new event event name power of math test event, we only have two values to pass in one of them is going to be base and one is going to be exponent and you can choose whatever values you want here i'm going to do 2 to the power of 3, the clik the save button:

![Screenshot](/images/img_10.png)

Run the test by cliking the test button, the base value of 2 to the power of 3 should give us 8 as a result:

![Screenshot](/images/img_11.png)

## Step 5: How to invoke our Lambda function
The way to invoke that math functionality or basically invoke that lambda function so our users obviously aren't going to go into the aws console like we just did and run it so we need a public endpoint or url that can be called to trigger that function to run and for that we're going to use api gateway this is a core service in aws that you can use to build your own apis application programming interfaces whether those are http rest or websocket APIs and it's really the perfect way to
invoke a lambda function.

To Creating a REST API for our Lambda function using API Gateway, on console navigate the API Gateway, create a new one by clicking on the create api button, we're going to use REST API, so click build button:

![Screenshot](/images/img_12.png)


Leave these first two options as they are so this will be rest and a new api and then we need to give it a name
so mine will be "power of math api". you can leave everything else the same and then create api :

![Screenshot](/images/img_13.png)

For the API method to be called, on the left make sure you have resources selected and then make sure you've got the backslash selected and then create method:


![Screenshot](/images/img_14.png)


The type of method will be a post and for integration type we're going to use a lambda function and then the lambda function name itself you'll need to start typing it should be power of math function, click on create method:

![Screenshot](/images/img_15.png)


One other thing we need to do is enable CORS or Cross Origin Resource sharing:


![Screenshot](/images/img_16.png)


Basically what this does is allows a web application running in one origin or domain to be able to access resources on a different origin or domain, because our web application is running on one domain and amplify our lambda function is going to be running in another we need to be able to work across those domains or origins, clik save:


![Screenshot](/images/img_17.png)


Let's deploy the api so we can test it out:  


![Screenshot](/images/img_18.png)


We'll need to set up a new stage you might have different stages for dev test production and so on this one we'll call dev and deploy:


![Screenshot](/images/img_19.png)


You'll need to copy the invoke url on a notepad and we'll need that for later:


![Screenshot](/images/img_20.png)

## Step 5: Creating a new DynamoDB table to store our math result

we're going to be using DynamoDB this is a key value or NOSQL database it's generally going to be
lighter weight than something like a relational database where you have to go set up your schema your relationships and we have to deal with permissions as well specifically we're going to need to give our lambda function permission to write to the database so let's go work on this next.

On the console navigate to DynamoDB, create table: 


![Screenshot](/images/img_21.png)


We want to create table for table name i'll do "power of math database", for partition key we'll say ID
you can leave everything else the same and create table: 


![Screenshot](/images/img_22.png)


We do need to save the Amazon Resource Name or the ARN for this so if you click into that table and under general information and additional info grab the ARN, and then just paste that into the same notepad or whatever you're using to store your links, and we'll come back and get that later: 


![Screenshot](/images/img_23.png)


## Step 6: Giving Lambda permission to write to the DynamoDB table

Navigate back to lambda and find the function and you want to go to the configuration tab (IAM)
and then if it's not already selected go to permissions and then you want to click on role
name, the execution role this should open up in a new tab and we basically need to add some
additional permissions to what this role has already permissions related to dynamodb:


![Screenshot](/images/img_24.png)


Add permissions and create inline policy, i personally find it easier just to work with the json code so click on the json tab and grab this code:


 ```bash
        {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "dynamodb:PutItem",
                    "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
                    "dynamodb:GetItem",
                    "dynamodb:Scan",
                    "dynamodb:Query",
                    "dynamodb:UpdateItem"
                ],
                "Resource": "YOUR-TABLE-ARN"
            }
            ]
        }

```


Copy all of this and replace what i have here and this is just basically saying allow
all these different actions in dynamodb so the lambda function is going to have
permissions to do all of these things on our dynamodb table.


You need to update this right here to that table arn that you copied just a minute, starting with ARN  ```bash YOUR-TABLE-ARN``` so copy that paste it: 


![Screenshot](/images/img_25.png)


Then we'll review policy, we'll give it a name "power of math dynamo policy" and finally create policy on the lower right:


![Screenshot](/images/img_26.png)



## Step 7: Updating the Lambda function code to write to the DynamoDB table

Update the lambda function to actually go right to the database it wasn't doing
that before so let's come back to the lambda function, copy and replace the code:


 ```bash
    # import the JSON utility package
        import json
        # import the Python math library
        import math

        # import the AWS SDK (for Python the package name is boto3)
        import boto3
        # import two packages to help us with dates and date formatting
        from time import gmtime, strftime

        # create a DynamoDB object using the AWS SDK
        dynamodb = boto3.resource('dynamodb')
        # use the DynamoDB object to select our table
        table = dynamodb.Table('PowerOfMathDatabase')
        # store the current time in a human readable format in a variable
        now = strftime("%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S +0000", gmtime())

        # define the handler function that the Lambda service will use an entry point
        def lambda_handler(event, context):

        # extract the two numbers from the Lambda service's event object
            mathResult = math.pow(int(event['base']), int(event['exponent']))

        # write result and time to the DynamoDB table using the object we instantiated and save response in a variable
            response = table.put_item(
                Item={
                    'ID': str(mathResult),
                    'LatestGreetingTime':now
                    })

        # return a properly formatted JSON object
            return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': json.dumps('Your result is ' + str(mathResult))
         }

```


Updated code make sure you save with a control very importantly make sure you deploy this pushes out your changes


![Screenshot](/images/img_27.png)


## Step 8: Updating the index.html page to call API Gateway

For this part we're going to need to update the index.html page so go ahead and copy the code, you need to update your api gateway endpoint "YOUR API GATEWAY ENDPOINT" with your url you saved on your notepad, it should end in dev if you created a dev stage like i did: 


```bash
    <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8">
            <title>To the Power of Math!</title>
            <!-- Styling for the client UI -->
            <style>
            h1 {
                color: #FFFFFF;
                font-family: system-ui;
                margin-left: 20px;
                }
            body {
                background-color: #222629;
                }
            label {
                color: #86C232;
                font-family: system-ui;
                font-size: 20px;
                margin-left: 20px;
                margin-top: 20px;
                }
            button {
                background-color: #86C232;
                border-color: #86C232;
                color: #FFFFFF;
                font-family: system-ui;
                font-size: 20px;
                font-weight: bold;
                margin-left: 30px;
                margin-top: 20px;
                width: 140px;
                }
            input {
                color: #222629;
                font-family: system-ui;
                font-size: 20px;
                margin-left: 10px;
                margin-top: 20px;
                width: 100px;
                }
            </style>
            <script>
                // callAPI function that takes the base and exponent numbers as parameters
                var callAPI = (base,exponent)=>{
                    // instantiate a headers object
                    var myHeaders = new Headers();
                    // add content type header to object
                    myHeaders.append("Content-Type", "application/json");
                    // using built in JSON utility package turn object to string and store in a variable
                    var raw = JSON.stringify({"base":base,"exponent":exponent});
                    // create a JSON object with parameters for API call and store in a variable
                    var requestOptions = {
                        method: 'POST',
                        headers: myHeaders,
                        body: raw,
                        redirect: 'follow'
                    };
                    // make API call with parameters and use promises to get response
                    fetch("YOUR API GATEWAY ENDPOINT", requestOptions)
                    .then(response => response.text())
                    .then(result => alert(JSON.parse(result).body))
                    .catch(error => console.log('error', error));
                }
            </script>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>TO THE POWER OF MATH!</h1>
            <form>
                <label>Base number:</label>
                <input type="text" id="base">
                <label>...to the power of:</label>
                <input type="text" id="exponent">
                <!-- set button onClick method to call function we defined passing input values as parameters -->
                <button type="button" onclick="callAPI(document.getElementById('base').value,document.getElementById('exponent').value)">CALCULATE</button>
            </form>
        </body>
    </html>

```


## Step 9: Re-deploying our index.html page using Amplify

Make a zip file out of this again so i'm going to delete our original zip file and then update index.html,compressed the file to a new zip and then we're going to need to go redeploy it using amplify, drag and drop the zip file to amplify, this will automatically redeploy.
